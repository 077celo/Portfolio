## Description

This project presents a highly optimized material in Unreal Engine, developed using C++. The primary function of this material is to simulate grass in expansive environments without sacrificing performance. Inspired by the efficient methods used in **Ghost of Tsushima**, my implementation can dynamically simulate a staggering number of blades of grass‚Äîup to **8 million**, compared to the typical range of **8,000 to 16,000**.

## Features

- **Bezier Curve Control**: Utilizes the mathematical principles of Bezier curves to dynamically control the appearance and movement of grass blades.  
  - **What is a Bezier Curve?**: A Bezier curve is a parametric curve frequently used in computer graphics to model smooth curves. It is defined by a set of control points, allowing for easy manipulation of the curve's shape and characteristics.

**Linear B√©zier curves**
Given distinct points P0 and P1, a linear B√©zier curve is simply a line between those two points. The curve is given by

This is the simplest and is equivalent to linear interpolation. The quantity ùëÉ1‚àíùëÉ0 represents the displacement vector from the start point to the end point.

- **Compute Shader and GPU Instancing**: Implements compute shaders for efficient blade generation and utilizes GPU instancing to maintain stable frame rates while rendering large amounts of grass.

- **Wind Map with Vertex Animation**: Adds realistic movement to the grass through a wind map that animates the vertices, enhancing the immersion of the environment.

- **Culling Techniques**: 
  - **Distance Culling**: Removes grass blades that are beyond a specified distance from the camera.
  - **Frustum Culling**: Only renders grass blades that are within the camera's view, optimizing performance.
  - **Occlusion Culling**: Prevents rendering of grass that is occluded by other objects, further improving efficiency.

- **Procedural Terrain Generation**: Generates terrain meshes procedurally using height maps, allowing for diverse and intricate landscapes.
