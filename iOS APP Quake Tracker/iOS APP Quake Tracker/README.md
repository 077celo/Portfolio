## Description

This repository contains all the code for the Earthquake Tracker app.
This project is still a work in progress because there are many more functionalities that I want to implement on it after testing, such as Volcano activity and Typhoon tracking.
By finishing this application I was able to improve my Swift and SwiftUI skills.

## Notes
This app/project was only developed for learning purposes.
